# LA Crime Data Analysis - EAS 587 Phase 1

## Project Overview
This project analyzes Los Angeles crime data from 2024 to present, covering 62,105 crime records. The analysis follows the data science pipeline including data acquisition, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization.

## Problem Statement
Understanding crime patterns is essential for effective law enforcement resource allocation and public safety planning. This project aims to:
- Identify temporal patterns in crime occurrence
- Analyze geographic distribution of crimes across LA areas
- Understand victim demographics and their relationship to crime types
- Provide actionable insights for crime prevention strategies

## Dataset
**Source:** Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) Crime Data  
**URL:** https://data.lacity.org/Public-Safety/Crime-Data-from-2020-to-Present/63jg-8b9z  
**Records:** 62,105 crimes (2024 to present)  
**Columns:** 28 original + 9 derived features

### Key Columns:
- `DATE OCC` / `TIME OCC`: Date and time of crime occurrence
- `AREA NAME`: LAPD patrol area (21 areas)
- `Crm Cd Desc`: Crime description (140+ types)
- `Vict Age` / `Vict Sex` / `Vict Descent`: Victim demographics
- `Premis Desc`: Location type where crime occurred
- `LAT` / `LON`: Geographic coordinates
- `Status Desc`: Investigation status

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip package manager

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd project-repo
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Analysis

1. **Data Cleaning:**
```bash
cd src
python data_cleaning.py
```

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:**
```bash
python eda.py
```

## Data Cleaning Operations (10)

1. **Date Column Conversion:** Converted `Date Rptd` and `DATE OCC` to datetime format; extracted Year, Month, Day, DayOfWeek, Hour
2. **Time Validation:** Fixed invalid time values (>2400)
3. **Missing Victim Info:** Replaced zero ages with NaN; filled missing sex/descent with 'Unknown'
4. **Categorical Standardization:** Standardized sex codes (M→Male, F→Female, X→Unknown); mapped descent codes to full descriptions
5. **Column Removal:** Removed `Crm Cd 2`, `Crm Cd 3`, `Crm Cd 4` (98-100% missing)
6. **Crime Categorization:** Grouped 140+ crime types into 12 categories (Vehicle Crime, Theft, Burglary, etc.)
7. **Premise Categorization:** Grouped premise types into 9 categories (Public Street, Parking Area, Commercial, etc.)
8. **Age Grouping:** Created 7 age groups (0-17, 18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, 65+)
9. **Coordinate Validation:** Flagged coordinates outside LA bounds (none found)
10. **Reporting Delay:** Calculated days between crime occurrence and report

## EDA Operations (10) - Following John Tukey's Principles

1. **Summary Statistics:** Generated descriptive statistics for numeric variables
2. **Temporal Patterns:** Analyzed crime by hour, day of week, and month
3. **Geographic Distribution:** Mapped crimes by LAPD area and coordinates
4. **Victim Demographics:** Analyzed age, sex, and descent distributions
5. **Crime Type Analysis:** Examined crime categories and premise types
6. **Reporting Patterns:** Analyzed reporting delays and case statuses
7. **Cross-tabulation:** Crime categories by victim sex and area
8. **Correlation Analysis:** Correlation matrix of numeric variables
9. **Outlier Detection:** Box plots for age, reporting delay, and hour
10. **Weapon Analysis:** Weapon usage patterns and types

## Key Findings

### Temporal Patterns
- **Peak crime hour:** 6:00 PM (3,911 crimes)
- **Highest crime day:** Friday (9,550 crimes)
- **Highest crime month:** May (9,388 crimes)

### Geographic Distribution
- **Highest crime area:** Central LA (6,024 crimes)
- **Lowest crime area:** Foothill (1,774 crimes)

### Crime Types
- **Top category:** Vehicle Crime (28,700 crimes, 46.2%)
- **Top premise:** Public Street (23,518 crimes, 37.9%)

### Victim Demographics
- **Median age:** 35 years
- **Sex distribution:** 37.6% Male, 29.3% Female, 33.1% Unknown
- **Top descent:** Hispanic (10,399), Black (4,089), Other (3,666)

### Reporting
- **Median reporting delay:** 1 day
- **Case status:** 94.5% under investigation

## Surprise Findings

1. **High proportion of unknown victim data:** 48.5% of records have unknown victim demographics (age=0, sex=X), suggesting many crimes are reported without victim information (e.g., property crimes)

2. **Low weapon usage:** Only 5.9% of crimes involve weapons, with "strong-arm" (physical force) being the most common

3. **Quick reporting:** 75% of crimes are reported within 3 days, indicating relatively prompt reporting

## Dead Ends

1. **Attempted crime analysis:** Initially tried to analyze attempted vs. completed crimes using crime codes, but the distinction was inconsistent across crime types and difficult to categorize reliably.

2. **Seasonal trend analysis:** Attempted to analyze seasonal patterns, but the dataset only covers ~1 year (2024), making seasonal comparisons impossible.

3. **Victim-offender relationship analysis:** The dataset doesn't include offender information or relationship data, preventing analysis of crime dynamics.

## Design Decisions

1. **Age handling:** Replaced age=0 with NaN rather than imputing, as 0 likely represents "unknown" rather than actual age
2. **Crime categorization:** Created broad categories to simplify analysis of 140+ crime types while maintaining interpretability
3. **Coordinate outliers:** Flagged rather than removed outliers to preserve data integrity
4. **Visualization approach:** Used multiple chart types (bar, line, pie, scatter) to reveal different aspects of the data

## Dependencies
